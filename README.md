## Professional Profile

Verification engineer specializing in coverage-driven development for digital datapaths and ML acceleration cores. Currently developing pipelined arithmetic units with signed/unsigned operand handling under Analog Devices' GP Scholars Program. My workflow: write verification plan → achieve functional coverage closure → implement RTL → close timing. Not the reverse.

## Technical Implementation Stack

| Domain | Expertise |
|--------|-----------|
| **RTL Design** | Pipelined datapaths • Booth-encoded multipliers • Signed/unsigned arithmetic • Clock domain crossing |
| **Verification** | UVM testbenches • cocotb • Constrained-random stimulus • Scoreboards with C++ golden models • Coverage closure |
| **Hardware Acceleration** | Systolic arrays • MAC units • Convolution kernel optimization • PPA tradeoff analysis |
| **Toolchain** | QuestaSim • Vivado • Quartus Prime • Linux CLI workflows • Verilator |

## Academic Credentials

**B.Sc. in Electronics & Communication Engineering**  
Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST) | Expected 2027  

**Industry Immersion**  
Analog Devices GP Scholars Program — silicon validation workflows, mixed-signal test methodologies, and production verification practices under ADI mentorship.

## Engineering Philosophy

> *"Verification is not a phase to be completed — it is the foundation upon which reliable silicon is built. I architect RTL with testability as a first-class constraint, not an afterthought."*

- Develop coverage-driven test plans before RTL implementation begins
- Build reusable verification components with golden model references (C++/Python)
- Characterize power, performance, and area tradeoffs during microarchitecture exploration
- Treat metastability not as a corner case but as a first-class design constraint
